If you want to use my code, follwing my my development approach. 

There is a main branch which is only used to keep the baseline copy. dev branch is the one which will have all the latest changes. So if you want to fork, use that. 
The moment a new project is started, a main and dev branch will be created. All repo will have their own user, upstream and down stream repo settings, use of global config is not recommended
